# dotfiles

This repo is my personal dotfiles repository.
It is pretty basic - I'm happy with the default config for most things!

## Using Chezmoi

This repo now uses [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) to manage dotfiles.

### Installation

First, you need to install Chezmoi. You can find the installation instructions in the [official documentation](https://chezmoi.io/docs/install/).

### Usage

To apply the dotfiles using Chezmoi, you can use the following command:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply michaeltinsley
```

This will initialize Chezmoi and apply the dotfiles from this repository.
For more information, please refer to the [Chezmoi documentation](https.chezmoi.io/docs/).
